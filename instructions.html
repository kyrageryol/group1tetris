    <p>After selecting the "New Game" button, you will be directed to a Tetris game play. There will be three modes to select from: easy, medium, & hard.</p>
    <p>The different modes represent different speeds. Easy is the easiest and slowest speed, and hard is the fastest speed.</p>
    <p>Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to move the pieces as they fall, press the SPACE bar to speed up the pieces as they fall.</p>
    <p>Use the back button to end the game or start over. The game will also reset once clicking the difficulty button.</p>
    <p>The objective is to arrange the pieces in an efficient way so that they do not touch the top of the screen.</p>
